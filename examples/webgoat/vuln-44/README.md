TEST vuln-44.attack

This test checks for the vulnerability in webgoat titled Off-by-One Overflows under the Buffer Overflows section.

This test can be run with the rest of the tests in the repo by running "gauntlt" in the base of the repo, or it 
can be run alone by running
```
gauntlt examples/webgoat/vuln-44/vuln-44.attack
```
from the base of the repo or calling the attack.py script directly.


It will return a
 - 1 (error) if the vulnerability is present
 - 0 (success) if the vulnerability is fixed (aka not present)

  This test assumes 3 things:

  (1) That the python package Requests is installed 
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip; sudo pip install requests
  ```

  (2) Gauntlt is being run from the base of the repo. For example, if you cloned the repo into /home/hacker, 
      the current working directory when running gauntlet should be /home/hacker/gauntlt-demo/ 

  (3) There is a local proxy running on 127.0.0.1:8888

  Testing vuln-44 can be done outside of Gauntlt by navigating to the webgoat/vuln-44 directory and running:

  ```
  $ python attack.py 
  ```
